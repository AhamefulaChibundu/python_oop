# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

This repo contains a code on python class. Below are the steps I took:

1. Create a Python class named Person.
2. The Person class should have the following attributes:
    1. name: representing the person's name.
    2. age: representing the person's age.
    3. gender: representing the person's gender.
4. Implement a method called introduce that prints a message introducing the person with their name, age, and gender.
5. Create an instance of the Person class and call the introduce method to display the person's information.
